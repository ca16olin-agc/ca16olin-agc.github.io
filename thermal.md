## Extreme Temperatures - High Temperatures

#### Problem
Many materials behave differently at very high temperatures. 
At around 300°C, silicon, which behaves like a semiconductor on Earth, starts to behave like a conductor. On top of the silicon circuit problem, the materials connecting the circuits has to survive the high temperature. 

#### Surviving the Venus
Venus is one of the most hostile environments in the Solar System. It is covered in sulphuric acid clouds, with surface temperatures near 460°C and atmospheric pressure of 90atm. 

The record for surviving on the surface of Venus was set by the Soviet Union’s Venera 13 lander, which touched down in 1982 and lasted 127 minutes.

Tough electronics that can handle a high temperatures, a way to cool a probe, a way to work with battery that does not generate as much power are required to last lonoger period of time. 

#### Possible plans for the new mission to Venus from NASA and Esa in 2020s
Silicon carbide-based electronics
They can operate longer periods in extreme high temperatures. HOwever, they are less powerful than modern computers

Stirling engines, with a helium as a working fluid
Stirling engines start with a working fluid inside a “cold” chamber (cold just means that the temperature is lower, rather than frigid). The fluid is compressed by a piston and moves to a second chamber, where it is heated. The heated fluid expands, moving a second piston, linked to the first via a wheel or arm. As the second piston moves the first it draws the fluid back to the cold side, where its temperature drops, and the cycle begins again. As long as there is a heat source, the engine keeps working.



## Extreme Temperatures - Low Temperatures
The environmental temperature in many NASA missions, such as deep space probes and outer planetary exploration, is significantly below the range the conventional electronics are designed for. Electronics capable of low temperature operation are required for many future NASA space missions where it is desirable to have smaller, lighter, and cheaper (unheated) spacecraft, such as Mars orbiters, landers, rovers, and deep space probes. 

#### Radioisotope Heating Unit (RHU)
Spacecraft operating in the cold environment of such deep space missions carry a large number of radioisotope or other heating units in order to maintain the surrounding temperature of the onboard electronics at approximately 20 °C. This is not an ideal solution because the RHU are always producing heat, even when the spacecraft may already be too hot, thus requiring an active thermal control system for the spacecraft. In addition, RHUs add cost and require elaborate containment structures. 

#### Semiconductor devices
The performance of certain semiconductor devices improves with decreasing temperature down to liquid nitrogen temperature at -196°C. At low temperatures, majority carrier devices demonstrate reduced leakage current and reduced latchup susceptibility. In addition, these devices show higher speed resulting from increased carrier mobility and saturation velocity. An example is the power MOSFET which has lower conduction losses at low temperature due to the reduction in the drain-to-source resistance RDS resulting from increased carrier mobility



## High Temperature Variation
Satellite Orbiting the Earth experience high temperature temperature variation ranging from >120°C on the side facing the sun, to <-150°C on the shadow side.
