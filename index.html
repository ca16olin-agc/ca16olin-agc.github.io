	<h2>Modular Redundancy For Spacecraft Computers</h2>

	<p>In a standard Computer Architecture class, the basic components are assumed to be operating under normal conditions, such as in Earth's atmosphere. However, under the harsh conditions of outer space, typical computer designs are more prone to errors. This website is meant to introduce how spacecraft computers can be designed to accommodate for errors, by first explaining the different environmental constraints, as well as historical methods for space computers. We will then discuss how redundancy can be built into a computer design, in order to reduce the possibility for error.</p>

	<h2>Website Navigation</h2>

	<p>In the Space Conditions tab, we will introduce to you the problems in space that may break a normal computer. In the History tab, you can go through a timeline of famous space crafts of the past that countered such problems in different ways.
	The Techniques tab contains information on Redundancy Management and Fault Control, the main architecture that counters problems in space. The Documentation tab reflects on our teamwork and building of this website. Lastly, the About and References tab gives a brief introduction to the members of the team, as well as all the references we consulted during this project.</p>
