	<h2>An Introduction: Space Computers</h2>
	
	<p>In a standard Computer Architecture/ Digital Logic class, students will learn about designing cpus, and maximizing them for efficiency. However, in the harsh conditions of outer space, the regular computer will break. In this website, we will introduce you to different problems in outer space, and how space exploration computers of the past have solved them. </p>

	<h2>Website Navigation</h2>
	
	<p>In the Space Conditions tab, we will introduce to you the problems in space that may break a normal computer. In the History tab, you can go through a timeline of famous space crafts of the past that countered such problems in different ways.
	The Techniques tab contains information on Redundancy Management and Fault Control, the main architecture that counters problems in space. The Documentation tab reflects on our teamwork and building of this website. Lastly, the About and References tab gives a brief introduction to the members of the team, as well as all the references we consulted during this project.</p>
