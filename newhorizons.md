New Horizons, launched in 2006, was designed for interplanetary travel. The spacecraft had two major computer system. One for commanding and data handling, and the other for guidance and control processing. The chips and circuits used in the computer are radiation hardened (MIPS R3000 CPU). Redundancy management is also present, as multiple clocks and timing routines are implemented to prevent errors in the computer process.
