The Voyager program was launched in 1977 to explore the further planets from the solar system while the alignments of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune were efficient for travel. Two probes were launched and are still in operation.

The Voyager program has 2 probes still in extended mission and are both around 16 billion miles away from earth. Redundancy management was a great theme in the Voyager computers as they each had 3 different computer types with 2 of each kind.
