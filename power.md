A computer needs power to run. Power to drive its clock, and to have its chip function. In the context of our computer architecture class, power (most likely) has been a simple matter of plugging in a chord to the wall. However, in deep space, power is a very precious and careful topic.


There are a few methods in which a spacecraft can generate power for its functions and its computer, although each has a few drawbacks. Solar panels are one of the major energy sources. However, solar panels are not a reliable source of energy. The power they generate is limited, especially when it is traveling in deep space or the sun is shielded by a planet.

Fuel cells use chemical reactions to convert chemical potential energy from fuel into electricity. Fuel cells have a limited amount of energy supply due to the constraints of weight and space available on a spacecraft.

Radioisotope thermoelectric generators are low maintenance compared to the other two methods but produce miniscule amounts of energy in comparison. A radioactive material releases heat as it is decaying, and the generator converts that heat energy into electricity.

Although the issue may solely seem as the finite amount of energy, there is still a major issue even if there were copious amounts of energy. The waste heat generated by energy consumption must be disposed of, but that is not an easy task. Radiator panels attenuate for this problem as they release heat.


Overall, although the computer itself does not use so much energy, minimizing energy usage is crucial for the overall maintenance of the ship, and it is best to minimize power consumption in design.
