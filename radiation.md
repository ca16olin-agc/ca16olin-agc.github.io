### Radiation in Space
Space is a highly radioactive environment. There are four primary causes of this radiation: trapped electrons, trapped protons, solar protons and cosmic rays. 

Trapped electrons are negatively charged particles that are relatively low in mass, but they are also extremely energetic. Due to their small masses, they are typically found is very high orbits such as the Geosynchronous orbits (or GEO orbits) that are approximately 36,000 km above the earth. 

Trapped protons are positively charged particles held captive by a planet’s gravitation field. They are less energetic that electrons, but they are approximately 2000 times more massive than electrons. They exist in high concentrations at low altitudes. For example, Low Earth Orbits (LEOs), such as those located 1400km – 2000km from the earth’s surface, are proton-dominated orbits. 

Solar protons are similar to trapped protons except they are ejected from the Sun during a solar flare event and are therefore not trapped in the planet’s gravitational field.

Cosmic rays are the final source of natural space-borne radiation. They are comprised of alpha particles, heavy ions and protons. 

Heavy ions are the primary concern when considering the effects of cosmic rays on semiconductors because the massive, highly charged particles can cause severe damage to devices. How trapped protons, trapped electrons, solar protons and cosmic rays interact with semiconductor components is generically called radiation effects. 


### Space Radiation Effects
Total Ionizing Dose (TID)

Single Event Effect (SEE)
	Single Event Latch-Up (SEL)
	Single Event Upset (SEU)
	Single Event Transient (SET)
	Single Event Functional Interrupt (SEFI)

Other Radiation Effect 
	Prompt Dose/ Dose Rate
	Neutron Single Event Upset

TID, SEL and SEU are most commonly used to show how resistant an electronic device is against radiation


### Radiation Hardening
Radiation hardening is making electronic components and systems resistant to damage and malfunctions caused by ionizing radiation.

#### Why is the technology behind
Due to the extensive development and testing required to produce a radiation-tolerant design of a microelectronic chip, radiation-hardened chips tend to lag behind the most recent developments. Radiation-hardened electronics are typically two to four generations behind commercial electronics in terms of performance.

#### How is it different from commercial electronics
Radiation hardened electronics contain extra transistors that take more energy to switch on and off, so that the cosmic rays can’t trigger them too easily. However, they are more expensive, power consuming and slow.

#### How to hardened against radiation
Process insulators so that there are fewer defects, which reduces the number of sites where positive charges can be trapped

Dope regions between transistors to make devices more resistant to the effects of radiation
Shield electronics in enclosures made of lead/ very dense materials to help protect the electronics from radiation
